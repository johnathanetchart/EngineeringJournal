# Wednesday, April 21 2021
  Today, I met up with Timmy and Austin K. We ate dinner and had boba. It felt good to talk code and job hunting tactics in person.

## Tasks
  tweaked Trello job search board
  read about 10 pages of Cracking the Coding Interview
  received an offer for referral to General Motors, should I find a position that I am interested in
  revised resume
  posted resume to LinkedIn
  updated LinkedIn projects
  set up LeetHub to commit LeetCode submissions
  did an easy toy problem [ContainsDuplicate] to confirm LeetHub config
  sent connection requests to rfp50 cohort

##
  For [ContainsDuplicate], I practiced a method that sorts and removes duplicates by changing to and from a set. The syntax is:
    let sorted = [...new Set(Array)]

## Notes
  Start applying to jobs TOMORROW
